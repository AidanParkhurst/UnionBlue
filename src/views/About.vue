  h1.section What is UnionBlue?
  p UnionBlue connects members of the Teamster's Union to lending institutions who can finance Personal Protective Equipment.
  h1.section Financing
  p Given the demand, many PPE manufacturers require cash upfront  vs the traditional NET 30-120 days after delivery, increasing the importance for flexible PPE financing solutions. 
  p UnionBlue connects distributors, manufacturers, and sellers of PPE products to institutions who can finance their receivables or supply chain through invoice factoring, working capital, or via short-term loans.   
  h1.section Who are we?
  p UnionBlue is made and maintained by Aidan Parkhurst, Marcus San Antonio, Vatsal Baherwani, and Nadil Ranatunga, seniors at the Bergen County Academies.
